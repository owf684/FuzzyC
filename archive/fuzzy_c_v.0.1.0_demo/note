fuzzy_c has finally begun to take some semblance of an engine.
As you can see there is some physics, some poor downward collision detection, and some input controls.
Felt so rewarding to get this to work I had to record. Thanks internet and chat gpt for helping me learn
about unique ptrs

I have finally figured out how to do collisions well using actual physics and boundary overlap 
Calculations. The collision are way more robust than they've ever been

After much experimentation I finally figured out the best course of action for UI integration was using IMGUI. In this demo I show case the ability to add objects to the scene by clicking around. The ui seen was all built using IMGUI. Thank you Chat GPT
